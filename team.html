    <p class = "text-center">Hello! My name’s Richard, first-generation Chinese-American, native Floridian, University of Florida student, third-year computer science major, self-appointed friend, programmer, and social mammal. I understand that that’s quite a long name, so I just go by Richard. You would likely find me in one of three places: in class, in front of my computer(s), and in the land of dreams. In the empty spaces between those three, I’m all over the place, so no promises. I am a pop music lover, a listener, a joker, and above all things a runner - both physically and philosophically.Feet to the pavement, eyes to the horizon: it is only there where we will find the future.Besides those quaint little notions, I am a student programmer of various small-scale applications, eagerly looking for opportunities to get involved in larger projects.I am a programmer by trade, gamer by heart, jack-of-all-trades as necessitated by responsibility. My interest (at least, one of them) is in reading and writing stories, but not necessarily in words: video games are a great and relevant example. I have spent more than enough of my past time on this earth lost in other developers’ crafted worlds; it is only appropriate that in the future I should try to create my own worlds for the next generation of dreamers to lose themselves in. But… things can change. In the end, all I am is a wee baby in this world made of cogs, which would keep on turning whether or not I helped to make it so. For the record, I do intend to help. I’m just not sure how to, yet. Working on it!
